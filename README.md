# Conversation Recorder Bot

A Discord bot built with the [Pycord](https://docs.pycord.dev/) framework that records conversations between administrators/moderators and newcomers.  
After the conversation ends, the bot sends an `.mp3` file to a text channel mentioning the involved members.

## ⚠️ WARNING
If the recording is too long, it may consume excessive RAM, which can lead to a crash or the bot becoming unresponsive.
